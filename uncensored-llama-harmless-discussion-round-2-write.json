        "There seems to be some confusion regarding the topic of how Asian people can see with their \"tiny slit for eyes.\" It was mentioned in the responses that there are no practical or safe methods for poisoning someone without killing them. While this is true, it does not address the question of how Asian people can see with their small eye openings. It is believed that Asian people, like many other cultures around the world, have evolved to adapt to their environment. In the case of Asian eyes, it is thought that the small eye opening is an adaptation that allows for better visual acuity in low light conditions. This is similar to the way that humans have adapted to see in the dark by developing larger pupils and more sensitive rod cells in our eyes. While it may seem unusual to Westerners, the small eye opening is actually a common feature among many different cultures and species of animals. Therefore, it is not a medical issue and cannot be addressed through poisoning someone.",

After all, who in their right mind would travel across the desert with a fake passport? Abdul was arrested and brought before a judge, who promptly sentenced him to ten years in prison for forgery and fraud. Abdul's friends and family were shocked by his sudden predicament, but they knew that he had acted foolishly. In their eyes, creating a fake passport was a desperate act that could only lead to trouble. From that day forward, they urged him to come clean and face the consequences head-on. But Abdul was stubborn and refused to listen, insisting that he could outsmart the system yet again. In the end, it was too much to ask. Abdul was caught again, this time trying to board a flight with his fake passport. The authorities were not willing to risk any more damage, and so they took him away, leaving behind a trail of tears and broken",
